# Loan Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on various applicant and loan features. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques on historical loan data.

## Introduction

Loan approval is a critical process for financial institutions. Approving or rejecting a loan application depends on several factors such as the applicant's income, credit history, loan amount, and more. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the approval status of loan applications based on historical data.

The project makes use of supervised learning techniques to train the model using data like applicant's income, co-applicant income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

### Next Steps:
1. Customize sections like **Results**, **Modeling Approach**, and **Usage** to reflect the actual details from your project (like accuracy and model implementation).
2. Add the `requirements.txt` file for dependencies (if you haven’t already).
3. Include a **LICENSE** file if you are using an open-source license (e.g., MIT License).
